 - The 'reduction' clause is supported on the following directives only:
     parallel, parallel for, for, sections, parallel sections, distribute parallel for,
     target parallel, target parallel for, teams, teams distribute parallel for,
     target teams distribute parallel for.
 - In addition, the 'reduction' clause is supported on a parallel or a simd directive
   nested within another parallel directive.
 - min- and max-reduction are unsupported.

 - 'target parallel' and 'target parallel for' are supported in part.
 - A maximum of 992 threads are supported in a target construct. Up to 1024 threads per team
   are supported in the constructs: 'target parallel', 'target parallel for',
   'target teams distribute parallel for', and 'teams distribute parallel for'.
 - The 'shared' and 'lastprivate' clauses are not yet supported.
 - When implicitly mapping a scalar as firstprivate, currently the scalar is made
   firstprivate on all threads in the parallel region.  The correct behavior is
   to make it firstprivate on the device but shared across all threads in the team.

 - 'distribute parallel for' is supported, but only dist_schedule and schedule clauses are extensively tested.

 - Other combined directives with 'target', 'teams' or 'distribute' are not supported.

 - Variable-length array types are not supported when their declaration is enclosed by
   '#pragma omp target' and used in a parallel regions.

 - Orphaned directives with 'parallel' and 'simd' are not supported in device functions.

 - Experimental support for "implicit declare target" is supported with the following option: -fopenmp-implicit-declare-target
